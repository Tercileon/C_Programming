1. You will be provided with mostly finished code. You will need to finish the function find_the_word. Do not touch the main()!
2. This lab is very simular to the demo lab just shown.
3. The purpose of this lab is to find the string (searchWord_ptr) inside of (sentence_ptr) and return a pointer to the first occurance of searchWord
4. find_the_word has 3 paramaters: sentence_ptr, searchWord_ptr and errorCode_ptr
-sentence_ptr is a char pointer to a null terminated string in main that we will search (haystack)
-searchWord_ptr is a char pointer to a null terminated string in main that we will find (needle)
-errorCode_ptr is a int memory address to store an error code
5. You will return a char pointer to the first occurrence of searchWord (if the whole thing exists)
6. In all other cases (NULL pointers, errors, word not found, etc) you will return NULL
7. You may ONLY use address arithmetic to access sentence_ptr and searchWord_ptr
8. Assign your error code to the memory address found in errorCode_ptr (error codes are defined at the top)
