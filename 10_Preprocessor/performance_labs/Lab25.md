# PERFORMANCE LAB 25

## CONDITONAL COMPILATION

* Redefine EOF as 66 (without compiler warnings)
* Use preprocessor directive(s) to:
    * Only compile in "release" and only compile if _INC_STDIO is defined
    * Prints the name of a MACRO and also print the integer value of that MACRO
    * Use a #else 'fall through' for ease of use and safety
* Use your preprocessor directives on FOPEN_MAX, FILENAME_MAX, and EOF
